# Sudoku-Solving-in-Haskell

This project attempts to create a code in Haskell that will generate a random unsolved variant of a Sudoku and continues to solve it. Variants of Sudokus include one with four additional 3x3 blocks that require a unique filling of the values 1 up to 9, and one where the diagonals are required to have a surjective function of the values 1 up to 9. Additionally, binary puzzles (which can be seen as a Sudoku variant) are implemented in Haskell. These different constraints on the Sudoku puzzle are investigated in how they affect solvability.
